	abstract = {Although vote intention polls are often used in the public debate as forecasts of future election outcomes, their predictive value has been subjected to scholarly inquiry. This research note contributes to the literature by assessing the predictive value of vote intention polls simultaneously at the macro-level (polls), meso-level (parties), and micro-level (voters). We analyse polls presented by the main polling agencies in the Netherlands (covering seven election cycles between 1998 and 2021), as well as micro-level panel data (covering 27,572 respondents and 46 polls between 2006 and 2010, and 35,574 respondents and 31 polls between 2010 and 2012). We reach three main conclusions. First, vote intention polls in the Netherlands generally do not provide more information than the previous election outcome, until the last few weeks of an election cycle. Second, the predictive accuracy of vote intention polls is lower for challenger parties than for non-challenger parties, particularly midway through the election cycle. Third, the predictive value for individual voters is generally very low, until the last few months before the election.},

	abstract = {Preschool education is regarded by many researchers and policymakers as a potential equalizer of educational opportunities. Yet, cross-national research shows that there exist large variations in the equalizing effects of preschool education across countries. In this paper, we study to what extent the national level of privatization of the preschool sector can explain these cross-national differences by examining its impact on the equalizing effects of preschool education. For this purpose, we use data from the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study 2016 for 24 countries. The results show that having spent more time in preschool is more strongly associated with primary school achievements for children of disadvantaged families. We ﬁnd some modest support that this compensatory pattern—in which preschool compensates for a reduced set of resources in the home environment—is somewhat weaker in societies with higher levels of privatization, though not reaching conventional standards of statistical signiﬁcance. The study highlights the relevance of considering the impact of national preschool settings on the distribution of preschool beneﬁts across children with varying socioeconomic backgrounds.},

	abstract = {Accepting defeat in the aftermath of elections is crucial for the stability of democracies. But in times of intense polarization, the voluntary consent of electoral losers seems less obvious. In this paper, I study whether affective and perceived ideological polarization amplify the winner–loser gap in political support. Using multilevel growth curve modelling on pre and post-election panel data from the British Election Study Internet Panel collected during the 2015 and 2019 UK general elections, I show that the winner–loser gap is indeed more pronounced amongst voters with higher levels of affective and perceived ideological polarization. Moreover, the results illustrate that polarized voters experience a stark decrease in their support for the political system following their electoral loss. Given the high and, in some Western democracies, rising polarization levels, these ﬁndings have important implications for losers’ consent and the stability of democracies in election times.},

	title = {Breaking free from linear assumptions: {Unravelling} the relationship between affective polarization and democratic support},
	abstract = {Scholars increasingly raise concerns about the alleged detrimental impact of affective polarization on citizens’ democratic attitudes. Yet, prior studies on the relationship between affective polarization and democratic support have yielded mixed results: Whereas some scholars report evidence that affective polarization erodes citizens’ support for democracy, others report null-findings. In this research note, we posit that one relevant explanation for these mixed findings is that the relationship between affective polarization and democratic support is not linear, but rather negatively curvilinear (i.e., an inverted U-shape). Though extreme levels of affective polarization may harm citizens’ democratic commitments, a moderate amount of affective polarization can strengthen democratic support by heightening the political stakes and stimulating democratic involvement. Employing Generalized Additive Modelling on data from the CNEP collected in Germany, the UK, and the US, we show strong and robust support for this negatively curvilinear pattern. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics between affective polarization and democratic support, as well as for the recommended estimation strategies of future studies that aim to explore this relationship.},
